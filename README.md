I developed a backend server service for a truck driving company as part of an acceptance project. The goal was to successfully implement their API documentation and deliver a functional backend solution, which secured my position with the company upon completion.

The backend system included key functionalities such as:

  - Authentication and Authorization: Validating user credentials and managing login processes.
  - Token Management: Generating and verifying tokens to ensure secure user sessions.
  - User Management: Fetching user data based on tokens and integrating with the company's database.
  - Driver Operations: Retrieving load information and facilitating driver communication through a messaging system.

I utilized Express.js and JavaScript to build the backend, leveraging the company's internal documentation hosted on Google Docs for guidance and alignment with their technical requirements. 
This project demonstrated my ability to deliver a production-ready solution while adhering to technical specifications.
